Environmental Dynamics &amp; Causality workshop (May 2024)

1.1_signals conceptually demonstrates decomposition of a time series into signal (oscillatory components) and noise and demonstrates the Fourier transform.
1.2_ssa runs singular spectrum analysis on time series data.
2.1_embed determines embedding parameters, embeds a time series in phase space, and runs a test for nonlinear stationarity.
3.1_ccm_LV runs CCM on simulated time series from a simple predator-prey model (Lotka-Volterra).
3.2_ccm_Kb runs CCM on time series for red tide (Karenia brevis) and related water quality parameters (from Medina et al., 2022).
./dat contains supporting data in csv files.
